# Stress Testing for Competitive Programming
This repository contains scripts for stress testing competitive programming solutions. The goal is to find hidden bugs and edge cases by generating random test inputs, running multiple solutions, and comparing outputs.

âœ… Features
<ol>
  <li> </li>Test Case Generator: Create random inputs within given constraints.</li>
  <li>Multiple Solutions Comparison: Compare outputs from a brute-force (correct) and an optimized solution.</li>
  <li>Automated Loop: Continuously run tests until a mismatch is found.</li>
  <li>Easy Setup: Simple to use with C++ solutions, can be adapted for other languages.</li>
</ol>
